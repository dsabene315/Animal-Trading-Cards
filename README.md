# Animal-Trading-Cards

Project Submission

- Once you're satisfied with your result, check your project against the Project Rubric to make sure you've satisfied all requirements.
- Take a look at the Udacity Style Guide for HTML and CSS, and try to align your code with the style guidelines. These guidelines are used to make code easier to read!
- Create a zip file containing card.html, styles.css, and your new animal image (unless you linked to an image hosted online).
- Submit your project to be reviewed.

Have fun and be creative 🐠 🐍 🐅 🐼 🐫 ! Writing CSS isn't an exact science, so feel free to experiment. For example, you might want to add rounded corners or a background color to your card. Your submission should resemble the design prototype, but it's okay if it doesn't match exactly, so long as you satisfy all the requirements.
